CHANGELOG
=========

.. towncrier release notes start

2.5.1 (2025-04-04)
==================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix packaging


2.5.0 (2025-03-23)
==================

Features
--------

- Client fixtures now have the ability to connect to existing DynamoDB instance maintained externally (like docker) (`#813 <https://github.com/dbfixtures/pytest-dynamodb/issues/813>`_)
- To avoid issues where the tests would delete development tables kept in docker instance,
  only tables that were created in tests will be removed.


Miscellaneus
------------

- Adjust links after repository transfer
- Adjust workflows for actions-reuse 3
- Download dynamodb from cloudfront instead of old s3 link
- Refactor code a bit to keep client and process fixtures separately, and extract config into separate subpackage.

  This will make it easier implementing noproc approach.
- Use pre-commit for maintaining code style and linting
